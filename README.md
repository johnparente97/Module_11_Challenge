## CryptoClustering README
### This repository is dedicated to exploring the classification of cryptocurrencies through the application of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA). The analysis goes into understanding the price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies across various timeframes, aiming to uncover meaningful insights into their market behavior and segmentation.
#### Components:

##### Data Loading and Preparation:
###### Initial steps involve loading cryptocurrency market data into a DataFrame and performing necessary preprocessing steps such as normalization.

##### Optimizing Clusters with Elbow Method:
###### The elbow method is utilized to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) based on the original scaled data, facilitating effective segmentation.

##### Cluster Analysis with Original Scaled Data:
###### Cryptocurrencies are grouped into clusters based on their price change percentages over different time intervals, providing insights into market trends and behavior.

##### Enhancing Clustering with PCA:
###### Principal component analysis (PCA) is utilized to reduce data dimensionality and enhance clustering performance, ensuring a more robust segmentation approach.

##### Analysis of PCA Data:
###### Clustering based on PCA-transformed data allows for a deeper understanding of cryptocurrency segmentation, shedding light on underlying patterns and trends.

##### Feature Analysis:
###### Examination of feature weights on each principal component provides valuable insights into the factors driving cryptocurrency segmentation and market behavior.
